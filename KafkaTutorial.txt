What is Kafka?? 
 -> Kafka is just like a messaging system.
 -> It act as a broker or act as queue 
 -> It is distributed platform/application
    
        Kafka Server(Software) listens to a particular port or an IP
        Producer -> sends message to kafka server.
                 -> generate some messages and those messages are published to Kafka Server
                 -> There can be multiple Producer that can generate messages and publish their
                        msgs to Kafka Server.
                
        Consumer -> It can consume messages from Kafka cluster.


-> In production env Kafka is refered as Kafka Cluster.
-> A cluster is made up of more than one kafka server.
-> Each Kafka server is referred as broker.

        Node1: broker1
        Node2: broker2
        Node3: broker3

    --> combination of these 3 kafka server is called Kafka Cluster.
    --> Data is distributed in kafka cluster.

 --> Kafka is fualt-tolerant : Ability of a system to continue without interruption when one or
        more of its components fail.
 --> In Kafka cluster messages are replicated in multiple broker.(Replication Factor)
 --> Kafka is scalable system.(You can add new broker)
                            --> You can increase the numer of consumers.

Why Kafka is Important? -|^


Kafka Architecture :
-------------------------------

    Kafka Server:
            Topics: -> can have multiple topics inside kafka server and
                        it can have multiple partitions.
            Publiser(P1/P2) : Each kafka server can have multiple kafka publisher/producer and can
                    publish to multiple partition of the topic
            Consumer group: Each kafka server can have multiple consumer group inside kafka ecosystem
                        Each Consumer group can have multiple consumers(C1/C2).
            
            CG1: C1  C2
            CG2: C3
            These consumer can consume directly from topic.
            -> A consumer cannot hang individually.
                It has to be associated/registered with a Consumer group

            Zookeeper: It is a distributed, open-source configuration, synchronization service.
                        (configuration managaement system)
                    All the data (CG/C/topic) are stored in zookeeper.
                    so, if there is any changes in configuration in kafka server it synchronizes with everything.

                        -> which messages consumer has been read
                        -> Cluster Information(location/Ip address)
                        -> Topic configuration.

Install :
    Download Software
    find both zookeeper and kafka server
        Need to change according to your system
        ========================================
        Kafka -> conf file = server.properties
        - advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://[server-ip-address]:9092
        
        Zookeeper -> conf file = zookeeper.properties
        - zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 
        ========================================
        Start zookeeper using : 
        - bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
        Start Kafka using : 
        - JMX_PORT=8004 bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties 
    
Install Kafka Manager:
    (GUI) to view Kafka Cluster
    Pre-req: Java11
    clone repository :  https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK
    -> go inside CMAK folder
    run: ./sbt clean dist
    --> target folder is created
        --> go inside universal folder
        --> unzip cmak*
        --> cd cmak/bin
    --> Change the configuration in application.conf
        - cmak.zkhosts=â€œzookeeper-host:2181" 

    --> Start the server using
        - bin/cmak -Dconfig.file=conf/application.conf -Dhttp.port=8080
